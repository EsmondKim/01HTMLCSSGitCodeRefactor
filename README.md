##01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor: A refactor of a website for accessibility.##  

This repository documents the refactoring of a website to add several accessibility features.  Several edits were made to the HTML and CSS code to increase the sites accessibility features.  
The <title> HTML attribute is now descriptive of the page.  
The original HTML code utilized non-semantic div tags, and this refactoring added several accessible semantic html tags.  
Alt descriptions were added to all images.  
The site now functions well with a screen reader to increase accessibility to the site.
In the refactoring process, syntax and indentation on the HTML and CSS code files were cleaned up and improved.
